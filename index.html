        <h2>(A) Teaching a Friend with Scriptures and Talk</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of teaching the gospel, often referred to as "gospel teaching," is multifaceted 
            and serves several important objectives:</p>
            (a) <strong>Encouraging Repentance:</strong><p>Teaching the gospel includes the principle of repentance, 
                helping individuals recognize and turn away from their sins and mistakes.
              It underscores the belief that everyone can change and become better through Christ's atonement.</p>

            (b) <strong>Promoting Love and Service:</strong><p>Gospel teaching emphasizes the importance of loving one's 
                neighbors and serving others. It encourages individuals to apply the teachings of Christ in their daily 
                interactions, fostering a spirit of compassion and kindness.</p>

            (c) <strong>Sharing the Good News:</strong><p>Gospel teaching is about sharing the "good news" of the gospel. It spreads the 
                message that salvation and redemption are available to all who come unto Christ, 
                regardless of their past mistakes or circumstances.</p>

            "Coming Unto Christ" talk. I emphasized the importance of coming unto Christ, repentance,
